# 1. create 1000 random numbers & store them in a variable called variable1
# 2. calculate sd. mean and median of value 1
# 3. Save output of sd. mean and median in R document along with your statements, name docusment as assignment3 R
# 4. Upload document on GitHub

variable1 <- rnorm(1000)

sd(variable1)
