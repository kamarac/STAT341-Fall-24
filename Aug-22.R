#Author: Kamara, 08/22/24, Purpose: Test the measures of descriptive stats

# name () = function 
# run code in console , if quit, anything ran is deleted 

# need data / input for a function

X <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

# we can append x & add 6 by writing: X<-6
# want to compartmentilize material on right side into X (variable)

Y <- 100

#though, if more than 1 #, use container / c 

#apply a fucntion for SD to calculate SD (of material in X):

# How to calculate standard deviation in R 
sd(X)

#  How to calculate mean in R
mean(X)

# How to calculate median in R 
Median(X)

#mode is not present in R language, though we can write own
